# Thaumcraft Node Viewer

A simple interactive web app that uses WebGL to render Thaumcraft 4 aura nodes the same way they appear in-game.

Thaumcraft 4 is a mod by Azanor for Minecraft versions 1.6.0 through 1.7.10 using the Minecraft Forge modding API. You can find it and other versions via [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thaumcraft) or Azanor's [official MinecraftForum thread](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1292130-thaumcraft-6-1-beta26-no-longer-being-developed).

I have NO idea what license the Minecraft font is under; all that the shady-looking font websites that let you download it are willing to tell me is that it's "donationware" that is "free for personal and commercial use" and that it was made by someone named Jacob Debono. I _think_ it comes from [here](https://www.1001freefonts.com/minecraft.font)? idk, the font scene is sketchy as hell. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
